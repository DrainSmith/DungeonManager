# DungeonManager
A small Windows desktop application to help D&amp;D 5e Dungeon Masters keep track of their characters' stats.

This program does not replace normal character creation. You will need need a Player's Handbook or the Basic Rules PDF from Wizards of the Coast.

You will need to have .NET 4.5.1 installed to run the program.
